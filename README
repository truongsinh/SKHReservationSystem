Note:
	0. username/password: admin
	1. PyCharm auto saves
	2. You need to run the sever once
	3. Data types
		["a", "list"] Lists are are mutable sequences of items of arbitrary types
		("a", "tuple") Tuples are immutable sequences of items of arbitrary types
		{"a", "set"} Sets are mutable containers of items of arbitrary types,
			which are very much like mathematical sets, useful for operations like set intersection and union.
		Dictionaries are mutable mappings tying keys and corresponding values
	4. Indent the whole block
	5. Run django console
	6. Up to now, we have 3 apps:
		Common
		Parking
		Update
	7a.Keep all your command line codes (example: p = Parking.objects.create(...))
	7b.Put all your test code into views of app Update, so when we have to reset database, we don't have to manually type those lines
		only go to http://[path]/update and everything is back! (eg. create user, create parking area, create parking slot...)
	8. Each object has two instances which will be created later
	9. Method is_free() is linked to transaction that will be corrected later
